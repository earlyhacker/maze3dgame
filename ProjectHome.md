(how the hell do we still get the high activity bar anyway?)
# Project terminated #
Further activity is highly unlikely.

# Description #
We are currently developing a project for the Spring Tournament. If you don't know what a "spring tournament" is, you're still welcome. In short, it's a tournament held on spring.

# What's done, at least partially #
  * Textured labyrinth
  * Fun sound stuff on the way
  * Local underground maze folks to annoy the player

more to come
